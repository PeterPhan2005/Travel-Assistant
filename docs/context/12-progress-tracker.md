# Progress Tracker

## Current phase

Phase 0 foundation work is complete: repository bootstrap, developer environment
verification, context/ADR approval, local PostgreSQL/PostGIS infrastructure and
continuous integration.

## Current goal

Begin T010 Android app task only when that task is explicitly assigned.

## Completed

- Product discovery decisions recorded.
- Android-first decision recorded.
- Strict real multi-agent definition recorded.
- Initial task backlog created.
- T000 Bootstrap repository.
- T001 Verify developer environment.
- T002 Approve context and ADR baseline.
- T003 Create local backend infrastructure.
- T004 Add CI checks.

## In progress

- None.

## Next up

- T010 Create Android Compose app.

## Open questions

- Final visual identity/project name.
- Exact Google Maps/MapLibre choice for first demo.
- Cloud deployment provider.
- Split of 30–50 curated POIs between HCMC and Bangkok.
- Exact list of source publishers accepted for narration.
- Exact production retention duration for rounded or redacted operational
  location-request logs within the accepted 7–30 day range.

## Architecture decisions

- Android native for lowest demo risk.
- Python backend for agent ecosystem.
- Code-orchestrated independent specialist runs.
- Curated-first POI and narration data.
- Room travel packages for offline mode.

## T002 baseline consistency review

| Area | Accepted baseline |
| --- | --- |
| Product scope | Vietnamese-first native Android travel assistant; text output initially, with voice limited to speech-to-text input. |
| Target users | Vietnamese domestic travelers plus selected outbound demo cases. |
| Supported cities | Ho Chi Minh City is primary and Bangkok is the international demo; 30–50 curated POIs total, with the city split unresolved. |
| Online/offline | Online mode may use approved provider adapters; offline mode uses only downloaded, versioned travel-package data and offers no new AI generation. |
| Curated data | Curated POI, menu, narration and local-culture records are the trust anchor; external sources may enrich them with provenance and freshness. |
| Grounding | Unavailable facts are never invented; unsupported claims are removed, missing fields stay missing and historical/cultural claims need sources or an explicit fallback label. |
| Stack | Kotlin/Jetpack Compose native Android; Python 3.12/FastAPI backend; PostgreSQL/PostGIS database; OpenAI Agents SDK runtime. |
| Authentication | Firebase Authentication with email/password and Google; token verification and authorization are deterministic services, not agents. |
| Agent runtime | Router → Discovery → deterministic ranking → Grounding Reviewer → Response Composer; Narration, Local Culture and Itinerary are optional specialist agents. |
| Deterministic services | Location acquisition, speech recognition, distance, opening-hours evaluation, ranking, authentication/authorization, offline search and package synchronization remain application services. |
| Privacy/permissions | No server-side exact location history or stored voice audio; foreground location and microphone permissions are requested only at their feature points; background location is outside MVP. |
| Task sequence | T000 through T003 are complete; T010 is the sole next task. T010 remains incomplete. |
| Implementation state | An Android Studio starter exists under `android/`, but application architecture and product implementation are incomplete. Local PostgreSQL/PostGIS infrastructure exists; backend application, database schema/migrations, data pipeline and agent runtime are not implemented. |

## Session notes

After each task, move it to Completed and set exactly one Next Up task.

T001 completed on 2026-07-19. It added a read-only repository verification
script and expanded Apple Silicon setup instructions. Git, Java 21, Android
Studio, Android SDK platform/build-tools/command-line tools, adb, an ARM64 Google
Play AVD, emulator acceleration, Gradle wrapper, Python 3.12, Node.js LTS, npm,
Codex CLI, Docker CLI and Docker daemon all passed. A physical Android device is
still required for later GPS/microphone behavior testing, but is not a T001
blocker.

T002 completed on 2026-07-21. Accepted context and ADRs now state the locked
runtime path, optional specialist roles, deterministic-service boundary,
grounding policy and actual starter-project state consistently. No application
source or build configuration was changed.

T003 completed on 2026-07-21. It added a single-service Docker Compose setup for
local PostgreSQL/PostGIS, a named persistent volume, explicit health check,
loopback-only host port and safe sample environment values. Compose validation,
database health, SQL connectivity, PostGIS availability and volume persistence
were verified without adding backend application code.

T004 completed on 2026-07-21. GitHub Actions now checks the existing Android
starter with debug lint, JVM unit tests and debug assembly, and checks the empty
backend boundary with pinned Ruff, mypy and pytest tooling plus a placeholder CI
smoke test. Workflow YAML parsing, read-only permissions, cache inputs and all
job-equivalent local commands passed. A deliberate temporary pytest failure
returned a non-zero exit status and was removed. The first remote CI run failed because sdkmanager was not on PATH. A follow-up CI fix invoked sdkmanager through ANDROID_HOME, and the subsequent GitHub
Actions run passed both Android and backend jobs.
